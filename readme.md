**Background**: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This web application is an online encyclopedia where users can view pages about certain topics. Users are also about to create and edit pages using Markdown text that will be converted to normal text that anyone can understand once the save is saved. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**Implementations**: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Home**: Takes the user to the home page where all the encyclopedia
entries are displayed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Create New Page**: Users are able to click the "Create New Page" button at any time in the sidebar and will be redirected to a page where they may enter a title for the page and a text field that the user should input Markdown content. Once saved, the Markdown content will be converted into HTML text that will be nicely displayed for that page with that title name.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Search**: Allows the user to type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry. User may type an exact match and will be taken directly to that page or they may also type part of a search and the webpage will return a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Edit Page**: On each entry page, users are able to click a link to be taken to a page where the user may edit that entry's Markdown content in a text field. The text field is pre-populated with the existing Markdown content of the page. User can click the save button to save the content or click the cancel button to make no changes to the entry. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Random Page**: Clicking "Random Page" in the sidebar will take the user to a random encyclopedia entry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**Future implementations**:
  1. Add styling to the entire page.
  2. Allow users to create an account and display which user(s) created/update a page.
  3. Allow for pages to be verified/locked so that the data can no longer be updated.
